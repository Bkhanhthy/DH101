# Week 5 – GIF & Remix Culture

## The Artifact
Describe or embed your artifact here.
The GIF shows a short moment filmed on campus where everyday movement repeats continuously. The loop captures a small action - people walking through a space and environmental movement like trees or background motion - that plays for about four seconds before restarting. Because the beginning and end connect smoothly, the motion appears endless. The scene is ordinary, but repetition makes the movement feel more noticeable and rhythmic over time.

## Process Notes
To make this GIF, I first filmed a short video on campus using my phone. I chose a location that had some movement, because I thought repetition would be more noticeable if something was changing in the scene. After recording the video, I uploaded it to ezgif.com to convert the clip into a GIF.

On ezgif, I trimmed the video to select a short moment that could loop smoothly. I decided where the GIF should start and end, adjusted the length, and tested different versions to see how the repetition looked. I focused on making the loop feel continuous so the transition between the end and beginning was less obvious.

There were several decisions involved in the process. I chose what to film, where to place the camera, and which part of the video to highlight. I also decided the duration of the loop and how fast it should play. These choices affected what viewers pay attention to and how the repeated motion feels. Even though the software automatically generated the frames and looping effect, my decisions shaped the final result and meaning of the GIF.

## Reflection
Respond to this week’s reflection prompt in 200–300 words.
Turning a short campus video into a looping GIF changed how I understood the moment. When the video played normally, it simply documented a passing scene. Once it became a loop, the moment felt stretched and exaggerated. The repetition made small movements - like the butterflies patterns or background motion - impossible to ignore. Instead of moving forward in time, the GIF traps the viewer in one continuous cycle. This shows how repetition can create meaning by directing attention to specific details.

Looping also changes emotion and perception. After watching the GIF several times, the scene begins to feel less natural and more mechanical, even though it shows a real place. The fifth time watching the loop feels different from the first because patterns become more visible and the moment feels persistent. The GIF makes the repeated motion central while flattening the larger context of campus life before and after that moment. This connects to remix culture because the original footage is transformed through repetition and recontextualization.

Human choice shaped the GIF at every stage. I decided what to film, where to position the camera, and which short segment to convert into a loop. I selected the start and end points and adjusted the timing to make the repetition smooth. These decisions determined what viewers notice and how the moment feels.

Automation also played a role. EZGIF automatically processed frames and generated the looping structure. AI and digital tools complicate authorship because they assist production, but they do not decide meaning. The technology creates possibilities, while human intention determines what repeats and why. This shows authorship as a collaboration between human agency and computational processes.
